Hello there! 👋 I'm Selmy, a passionate software developer with a deep love for crafting elegant code and solving intricate puzzles in the digital realm. When I'm not immersed in the world of programming, you can often find me exploring the wonders of our planet. Travel is not just a hobby for me; it's a profound source of inspiration that fuels my creativity. I believe that every new destination is a classroom, and every culture is a lesson waiting to be learned. Beyond the realms of technology and travel, my zest for knowledge knows no bounds. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to expand my skill set and embrace the thrill of learning. Join me on this journey of discovery, where every line of code and every passport stamp is a testament to the adventure that is life! 🚀✨
